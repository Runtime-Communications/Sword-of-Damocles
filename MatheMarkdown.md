## MatheMarkdown

**MatheMarkdown** is an attempt to enumerate the rudiments of mathematics in Markdown. It will involve the use of all the syntax examples I just got from Copilot as well as all the ones used to make cool-looking mathematical symbols. 

##Getting Down
*Equations* are important in mathematics. Take, for instance, the equation of a circle: \(x^2 + y^2\) or the quadratic formula $$\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

These are amazing formulas that deserve to be written down attractively. This is accomplished using Markdown and, according to Copilot, some syntax it borrows from LaTex.
